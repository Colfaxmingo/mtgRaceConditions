# mtgRaceConditions
Evaluation of mtg cards from JSON data



Magic is a card game that is fundamentally a race
It is similar to the card game War but players do not have the same 26 cards
Instead each player has 60:7 cards at the start and race to eliminate the other player
Cards have many different properties that matter and there are multiple finish lines

This project is an attempt to evaluate an individual card based on how quickly it advances the race
Card properties are predetermined by the publisher Wizards of the Coast and here collected and parsed by Scryfall
